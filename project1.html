            <h1>Project 1: Photo assignment</h1>
            <p>
                Below you will see my latest assignment.
                The assignment was to shoot different types of photos; Landscape, product and portraits.
                After doing this we had to edit them to improve the quality and learn different aspects of photo editing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Every picture on the left is the after-editing picture and the picture on the right is the before-editing picture.
                <br><br>

                This landscape photo was shot in Faaborg in december on my iPhone X.
                I saturated the picture and gave it warmer tones to make it more appealing.
                The photo was edited in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.

                This landscape photo was shot in Faaborg in december on my iPhone X.

                I saturated the picture and gave it warmer tones to make it more appealing.
                I gave the photo more height and removed the horizontal lines behind
                the ringbox to make it look more professional. I also used healing to remove
                the scratches on the glass the ringbox stands on.
                The photo was edited in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.

            <p>
                This portrait photo was shot in UCL Medialab with a Sony Alpha A7 Mark 3.
                I tried to soften my dark roots, but this doesn't look that great.
                I saturated the picture and gave it warmer tones to make it more appealing.
                The photo was edited in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.

            <p>
                This portrait photo was shot in UCL Medialab with a Sony Alpha A7 Mark 3.
                I exposed and saturated the picture and gave it warmer tones to make it
                more appealing and my face became more visible.
                The photo was edited in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.

            <p>
                This portrait photo was shot in UCL Medialab with a Sony Alpha A7 Mark 3.
                I tried to make B/W silhouette photo and exposed myself to make the photo
                more appealing and nicer to focus on for the eyes.
                I also cropped the photo to get closer and give it more of a close-up effect.
                The photo was edited in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.
